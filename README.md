# Options:

- Overlay: Shows the stuff outside Canvas
- No Color: Erase the external boundaries color
- Crop: It creates a hole in the middle that doesnt update the overlay in that area
- Edges: Black outline on the canvas edges
- Op: Opacity of the Overlay
- Color square: For choose the color of the external boundaries

# Modes:

- Normal
- Wide
- Ultra
(This is for how close is rendering near the cursor, if it's highier worst performance but better covered area)

* Full Document:
Shows all the layers

* Current layer:
Show only the current layer

# Disclaimer:
- Undo and redo doesn't work well on Full Document mode. The update is only achieved after release detection when painting.
- Not All the brushes work for real time updates and idk why so it will stay as it is
- This plugin is made for 8bit/depth chanel
